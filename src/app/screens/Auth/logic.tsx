/**
 * Project Name
 * Component/Feature Name
 * Created by Mateusz SkwierczyÅ„ski
 *
 * The purpose of this file is to separate component business logic from the 'view' itself.
 * Thanks to following the 'Presentational and Container Components' pattern it's much easier
 * to test and find any potential business logig bugs without the need to looking through UI view.
 * It's also a great place to define hooks and functions. Thanks to this approach we can create
 * a separate environment for part of dev team responsible for managing local state and comunicating
 * with global state.
