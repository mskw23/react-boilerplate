/**
 * React Boilerplate
 * Auth screen index
 * Created by Mateusz SkwierczyÅ„ski
 *
 * This is a entry file to our screen. This file's main goal is to deliver
 * the ready-to-use component with all functionalities merged together.
 * In this file we're connecting the component to redux store. It's also,
 * at the same time, the last station of the screen structure pipeline.
 *
 * The overall pipeline looks like this:
 * view -> logic -> index -> client
